Day 1:
Python is dynamically typed language that is based on value stored in the variable the data type
is decided.
type function will return the datatype of given variable
some examples we covered str,int,float,bool
print function used to print anything on the console
input function is used to take input from console and it converts to string datatype

Day 2:
Bool function will convert Number to boolean
For anything greater than or Less than 0 it will give True
For 0 and 0.0 It will give False
For empty string("", '',"""""") bool function will be false or else will be True)
--
For bool value Int conversion will either give 0(False) or 1(True)
For Float Int conversion will remove the decimal part and integer part or Non decimal 
part will be returned as part of int conversion
For string Int func will check the content with in a string
if the content is Int then Int function can able to convert to Int else throws error
--
for Boolean to float conversion will work 
True - 1.0
False-0.0
for Int to float 
for 5 it is 5.0
for string if content is number it will work else throws error 
"ValueError: could not convert string to float: 'abc'"
--
print(a//b)#0 without decimal value
print(a**b)#exponential three times of 1
--
Everything can be converted to String
